# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analyis was to compare the Pyber data based on the type of city. By doing this, I was able to provide information about the relationship of the city type when compared to other variables

## Results
After creating a summary dataframe, I was able to compare the city types with the amount of riders, drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. The image is included below.

### Pyber Summary Dataframe

According to the dataframe, the total number of rides, drivers, and fares increased from Rural, Suburban, and Urban city types, respectively. Contrastly, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver decreased by city type in the same respective order. 

Through further analysis, I was able to create a line chart that displayed fare differences by the type of city between the dates of 2019-01-01 and 2019-04-28. The image of the chart is included below.

### Pyber Fare Summary

In all city types, fares had the tendency to peak towards the end of February that year. As stated previously, the lowest fares were in rural city types, followed by suburban city types, and were the highest in urban city types. 

## Summary
Based on the results of my analysis, I would recommend a few things to improve disparities between the different types of cities. Firstly, I recommend marketing more Pyber driver jobs to people living in suburban and rural areas. With an increase of drivers, riders would not have to pay as much in rural areas, which may currently decentivize them from using Pyber. Secondly, I would recommend having more drivers be available during the winter months. People are more likely to use Pyber during the winter time, and with more drivers available, this would increase the total revenue. Lastly, I would also increase fares during the winter months since people are less likely to use other modes of transportation during colder or snowy months.
